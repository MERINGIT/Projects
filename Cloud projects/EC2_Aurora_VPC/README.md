#  Compute, Network & Security

## Overview
This is an individual assignment aimed at assessing your understanding of compute, storage, network, and security mechanisms using AWS services. You will demonstrate your ability to work with AWS EC2, VPC, RDS, and other related services.

## Learning Outcomes
- Launch and manage AWS EC2 instances.
- Configure Virtual Private Clouds (VPC) for secure architectures.
- Implement public-facing and private services within a VPC.
- Work with AWS libraries for cloud operations.
- Build REST APIs and handle JSON data.

## Requirements
- Build a web application deployed on an EC2 instance within a VPC.
- Public-facing service accessible via public IP or elastic IP.
- Implement `/store-products` (POST) and `/list-products` (GET) endpoints.
- Connect to an AWS RDS database in a private subnet within the VPC.
- Store product data in the database and retrieve it via API endpoints.

## Project Details
This assignment will measure your understanding of compute, storage, and network concepts using AWS services such as EC2, VPC, and RDS. You'll implement a web application deployed on an EC2 instance within a VPC, with public-facing and private services connected to an RDS database. Ensure compliance with AWS best practices and proper documentation throughout the project.

## Conclusion

This assignment is designed to test your proficiency in AWS services and cloud computing concepts.
