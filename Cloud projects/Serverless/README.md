## Serverless Computing

## Overview
This individual assignment assesses your understanding of serverless mechanisms using AWS services. You'll work with AWS Lambda, Step Functions, and API Gateway to build RESTful APIs and implement a finite state machine.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand the benefits of serverless computing.
- Implement a finite state machine using AWS Step Functions and Lambda.
- Learn how to build serverless APIs with AWS API Gateway.
- Gain knowledge about common encryption algorithms.

## Requirements
- Build REST API entry points using AWS Lambda and Step Functions.
- Create a State Machine configured with API Gateway.
- Evaluate choices based on input and invoke Lambda functions for hashing operations.
- Demonstrate understanding of serverless compute mechanisms and API Gateway configuration.

## Project Details
This assignment focuses on leveraging AWS Lambda, Step Functions, and API Gateway to create a serverless architecture for handling REST API requests. You'll design a State Machine that processes inputs from API requests, makes decisions based on the input, and triggers Lambda functions to perform hashing operations on data.

## Conclusion
This assignment challenges you to apply your knowledge of serverless computing and AWS services to build a functional and efficient serverless architecture. By implementing a State Machine with API Gateway and Lambda functions, you'll demonstrate your ability to create secure and scalable REST APIs in AWS.
